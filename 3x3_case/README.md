# A winning strategy for Determinant Tic-Tac-Toe on an nxn board

## Definitions and Terminology
Let's define our board as an nxn matrix of 0s and 1s.
```math
    B \in M_n(\Set{0, 1})
```
```math
    B = \begin{bmatrix}
        R_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        R_n \\
    \end{bmatrix}
```
```math
    R_i = (r_1, \dots, r_i)
```
